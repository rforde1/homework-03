## Installation

1. Had to clone the repo from my Git Hub page and create my files and folders. 
2. Created bootstrap and stylesheet links to customize my page based on Homework-1 style requirements (colors, font-styles, etc)
3. Used bootstrap to give nav bar then used style.css to overide Bootstrap code for responsive website.
4. Once all of the html and css was done, i had to target element/id/classes with js to manipulate the page.
5. Had to create functions to define password length and objects for password 
6. Used 'function password()' to store an argument of length of password based on user choice 
7. Create 'event listener' function so that based on user choice letters/numbers/or symbols can be used if used, so that if/when user clicks 'generate' button password will display in text box with either choices. 
8. Created copy button so that user can copy to clipboard and alert the user which password was copied. 
9. Created link in html to lead user back to my portfolio where all of my applications are.
